Investigating potential moderators in this way will help us tailor the second-stage intervention for non-responders based on the status of the participants up to the point of non-response. We are only able to investigate non-responders since those were the only individuals who were re-randomized. Because all responders in this study continued on their first-stage intervention, we are unable to assess whether a different tactic would be better for some responders.\n\nWe'll start by fitting a **moderated regression model** using the data from non-responders. The goal is to discover if we can use *the initial treatment* `a1` and *adherence to initial treatment* `o22` to select a tactic for non-responders, adjusting for baseline covariates. The model is as follows:\n\n$$ E[Y \\mid \\mathbf{O_{1}}, A_1, O_{22}, A_2, R = 0] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 O_{11c} + \\beta_2 O_{12c} + \\beta_3 O_{13c} + \\beta_4 O_{14c} + \\beta_5 O_{21c} + \\beta_6 A_{1} + \\beta_7 O_{22} + \\beta_8 A_2 + \\beta_9 (A_2 \\times A_1) + \\beta_{10} (A_2 \\times O_{22})$$\n\nPay particular attention to $\\beta_6$, $\\beta_7$, $\\beta_9$, and $\\beta_{10}$, as these represent the main effects and interactions (with second-stage intervention), respectively, of the two moderators we are interested in for this analysis. Let's fit the model."
